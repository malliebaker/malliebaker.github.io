                    <h2>Elementary School</h2>
                    <p>
                        For this activity, students learned healthy habits such as using a tissue when you sneeze. To reinforce this behavior students colored Elmo and glued a tissue onto his nose. We all had so much fun!
                    </p>

                    <h2>Middle School</h2>

                    <p>
                        These signs were made in my Girl Empowerment Group. The girls actually suggested to me that they would like to make signs that had positive messages to hang around the school. I was delighted by the idea, so we all made a poster and hung them around the school to help boost morale.

                    <h2>High School</h2>

                    <p>
                        This is a photo of my Guyâ€™s Group. In this particular lesson the students and I were playing a game that I created about identifying our feelings. Since it can be hard for guys to talk about their emotions, I found that adding a somewhat competitive aspect was really helpful for breaking down walls!
